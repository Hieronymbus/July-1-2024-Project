# Project Brief: To-Do List Application

## Overview
This project involves creating a dynamic to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective is to provide a hands-on experience with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The design should be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the provided color scheme and layout.

## Design Specifications
- **Background**: Dark blue (#172a3a)
- **Highlights and Buttons**: Neon blue (#51e5ff)
- **Icons**: Light grey (#67737d)
- **Text**: White (#ffffff)
- **Settings Icon and Outlines**: Very dark grey/black (#12202c)
The design must be responsive and provide a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Functional Requirements
- **Add Task**: The user should be able to add a new task to the list by entering text into an input field and submitting it.
- **Display Tasks**: Tasks should be displayed in a list format, with each task showing options for edit and delete.
- **Edit Task**: Users must be able to modify the text of existing tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Users should have the option to remove tasks from the list.
- **Sorting**: Implement functionality to sort tasks, possibly by name, status, or date-created.
- **Searching**: Allow users to search for specific tasks using a search bar.
- **Filtering**: Provide options to filter tasks by date-created or other relevant parameters.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS**: To style the application according to the provided color scheme and design.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the application's interactivity, handling CRUD operations.
- **JSON-server**: As a mock backend to store and serve tasks data in JSON format.

## Deliverables
- **Source Code**: A complete set of source files including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Live Demo**: A working version of the application hosted on a suitable platform for demonstration purposes.
- **Documentation**: A readme file that includes the pseudocode for your solution.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Adherence to design specifications and color scheme**.
- **Correct implementation of CRUD operations**.
- **Code quality, readability, and use of best practices**.
- **Functionality of sorting, searching, and filtering features**.
- **Use of JSON-server for data handling and persistence**.
- **Responsiveness**.

## Submission Instructions
All code must be submitted by Wednesday 20th March, 2024.

## Support
For any questions or clarifications, please reach out to the tutor. Also, this project folder contains a directory `tutorials` which contain tutorials and examples of CRUD operations, searching, sorting, and filtering operations in JS. Revision classes will be held for 30 mins every day on the following concepts: arrays, loop, and conditionals. Regular check-ins will be scheduled to ensure the project is on track and to address any challenges promptly. Happy coding:)\n\n
