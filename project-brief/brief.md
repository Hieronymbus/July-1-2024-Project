# Project Brief: Dynamic List Application

## Overview
This project involves creating a dynamic list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to give a practical experience with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without using a server-side script or database. The design should be user-friendly and visually appealing, staying true to the provided color scheme.

The design should be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on various devices.

## Functional Requirements
- **Add Item**: Users should be able to add a new item to the list through an input field.

## Submission Instructions
All code must be submitted by Wednesday 3rd July, 2024. We will extend this project to include an API for getting the weather data. Use github for this project.

## Support
For any questions or clarifications, please reach out to the tutor. Also, this project folder contains a directory `tutorials` which contain tutorials and examples of CRUD operations, searching, sorting, and filtering operations in JS. Revision classes will be held for 30 mins every day on the following concepts: arrays, loop, and conditionals. Regular check-ins will be scheduled to ensure the project is on track and to address any challenges promptly. Happy coding:)
